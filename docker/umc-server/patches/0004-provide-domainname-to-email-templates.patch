Subject: [PATCH 4/9] provide domainname to email templates

The default email templates from the self-service package are not used
by the openDesk project, instead openDesk brings its own template:
- The default template does not mention on which domain a password-reset was triggered.
- The tokens are only valid for a short time (48h), the default template does not mention how to generate a new token.
- The default template links to the "/univention/selfservice" portal. After closing/finishing/discarding the password reset dialog, one remains stranded on the selfservice portal, which does not have an obvious option to login (it is hidden in the sidebar).

This patch adds two additional placeholders to be used in email templates,
which contain the domain from which the passwordreset originated.
