"""UDM License replacement

Non-functional replacement for
`.../dist-packages/univention/admin/license.py`
from the package `python3-univention-directory-manager`.

It is sourced by `.../dist-packages/univention/admin/uldap.py`.

Added to avoid a dependency
to `.../dist-packages/univention/license.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`
from the package python3-univention-license.
